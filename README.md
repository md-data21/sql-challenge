# sql-challenge

## This is the Read Me file for the SQL project

### In this project, I am acting as a data engineer for a company. My tasks are to: 
######
    - Determine the best ERD strategy for the data set
    - Create an ERD including Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, data types, and other constraints, as well as considering future data integrity
    - Use that ERD to create a schema to make the uploading of the data sets easier, more efficient, and correct
    - Once the data tables are in a SQL database, write queries to determine the correct employee lists for each ask

##### I used PostgreSQL to import my schema, import the raw data CSV files, and write my queries. Within my queries I used the following functionality:
    - INNER JOIN (on 2+ tables at a time)
    - WHERE functionality
    - ORDER BY functionality 
	- LIKE functionality
	- Wildcards 


##### I really enjoyed this project and look forward to using SQL more in the upcoming projects. I hope to use SQL on a regular basis once out of the bootcamp as I feel very comfortable with it.
